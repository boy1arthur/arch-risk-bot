# 🏗️ BoGum Bot: The Architecture Guardrail

**"Insurance against Technical Bankruptcy."**

## 1. The Problem: The Invisible Collapse
GitHub is full of "Auto Reviewers" that find commas and bug-fixes. But CTOs have a different nightmare: **The Legacy Collapse.**
- **Architecture Drift**: Code implementation slowly deviates from the design intent until it's unfixable.
- **God Modules**: Files that grow so large they become a black hole of risk.
- **Circular dependencies**: A web that makes local changes cause global crashes.

## 2. Our Solution: The Guardrail
BoGum Bot doesn't just review code; it **protects architecture.**
- **High-Fidelity Context**: It understands Python/Django structural norms.
- **Proactive Warnings**: It flags a "God Module" before it's too late.
- **Dependency Guard**: It blocks circular imports that would degrade the system quality.

## 3. Market Positioning
We aren't a calculator (Copilot); we are the **Structural Integrity Inspector.**
- **Value**: Reliability, Maintainability, and Predictability for Growing Teams.
- **Target**: CTOs of Series A/B startups who "feel the technical debt" but can't see it yet.
