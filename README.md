### The Final Question Before Deploy.

AI wrote your code.
Hotfixes patched it.
Deadlines rushed it.

> **Would you deploy this today? 🚀**

Run this just once before you push that deploy button.

```bash
npx archrisk check .
```

✅ **No Install** · **Runs Locally** · **Free Static Audit** · **Results in 30s**

## 🎯 What is archrisk?

**archrisk** is a **Code Release Readiness Platform**.
It’s not just a linter—it’s a **Pre-Deploy Ritual**.

Our goal is to get teams asking each other right before deployment:

> *"Did you run archrisk?"*

---

## ⚡ Quick Start

### 1️⃣ Free Release Readiness Check (No LLM)

```bash
npx archrisk check .
```

✔ **No installation required**
✔ **Zero API cost**
✔ **No code leaves your machine (Local Analysis)**

**Example Output:**
```text
Release Readiness Score: 45 / 95 🟡

Risk detected:
• [RR-CI-001] CI/CD pipeline missing
• [RR-TEST-001] No automated tests found
• [RR-LOG-001] Logging not configured
```

---

### 🧠 AI Deep Audit (Optional)

Use your own API key for deeper architectural analysis.

```bash
npx archrisk config
npx archrisk audit .
```

AI is used ONLY in this step.
👉 **BYOK (Bring Your Own Key)**
We do not use your API quota.

## 🧪 Production Readiness 11

**archrisk** checks only the critical metrics that cause real production outages.

| Domain | Check Item |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Delivery** | CI/CD Pipeline Existence |
| **Testing** | Automated Tests |
| **Observability** | Logging / Error Handling |
| **Architecture** | Circular Dependencies |
| **Maintainability** | God Modules |
| **Security** | Dangerous Function Usage |
| **Config** | Configuration Isolation |
| **Reliability** | Disaster Recovery Prep |
| **Scaling** | Structural Bottlenecks |
| **Documentation** | Deployment Guidelines |
| **DevOps** | Automation Level |

## 📜 Standardized Audit Report

Every risk is reported with the same structure.

- **Title** — Risk Name (with ID)
- **Evidence** — Detection proof
- **Standard** — Industry Standards (Official Docs)
- **Impact** — Business Impact
- **Action** — Solution (Copy-Paste Templates)
- **Reference** — Link to official documentation

This is the difference between asking AI *"Is this code okay?"* vs. running **archrisk**.
👉 **Consistent Standards + Actionable Solutions**

---

## 🔒 Privacy First

**archrisk** is primarily a **Local Analysis Tool**.

🚫 **No Code Upload**
🚫 **No Accounts Needed**
🚫 **No Tracking**

AI Deep Audit runs strictly with your own API key.

---

## 🧭 Why this exists

Most outages don't start with "complex bugs"—they start with **unprepared deployments**.

❌ No Tests
❌ No CI
❌ No Logs
❌ No Environment Isolation

And yet, the deployment goes through.
**archrisk** was built to pause that moment.
